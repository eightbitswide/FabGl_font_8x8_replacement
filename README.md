# FabGl_font_8x8_replacement
 PETSCII Interpetation of 8x8
 By Eightbitswide

 Not a perfect translation because each ASCII character can be two different PETSCII characters.
 Replication of shifted alpha characters placed in the area which colors are typcial.
 Some additional characters also added because there was plenty of space.

 For easy insertion into the FabGL terminal, replace font_8x8.h in the /FabGL/src/fonts/ library folder
 with this file (after renaming the original as a backup) and recompile AnsiTerminal onto your device.
